# Relational Model

## Architecture

Proposed in 70s by Edgar Frank Codd at IBM, the relational model is a database model based on the mathematical concept of a relation. A relation is a table with columns and rows. The columns have a name and a type, and the rows are the records of the table.

Its widely used in the industry because of its simplicity and flexibility. Also it is a `madure` model, with a lot of tools and resources available.

Very usefull to **big data** and **data science**.

### For what is used?

- **Large transactional volume**: It is used in systems that need to process a large number of transactions quickly and efficiently. For example, a bank system that needs to process millions of transactions every day. This requires a `CRUD` operation.

- **It is quick and efficient**: It is designed to process transactions quickly and accurately. It is optimized for processing a large number of transactions at the same time.

- **Data integrity**: It is designed to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent. It is designed to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent.

- **Avoid data redundancy**: It is designed to avoid data redundancy. It is designed to avoid data redundancy.

- **Keeps concurrent data**: It is designed to keep the data up-to-date. It is designed to keep the data up-to-date.

### Weaknesses

- **Analyse data**: It is not designed to analyze data.

- **Historical data**: It is not designed to keep historical data.

- **Data Scalability**: It is not designed to handle a large amount of data.

- **data redundancy**: It is not designed to keep a archive of data.

This type of architeture is designed to `Transaction Processing` and `Data Integrity`.
