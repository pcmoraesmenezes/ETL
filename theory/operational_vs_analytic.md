# A comparative of Operational models and Analytic models

## Operational models

This model is responsible to keep the entire system running. For example, a payroll system is an operational model. It is responsible for calculating the salary of employees, generating payslips, and transferring money to the bank accounts of employees. The operational model is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the system.

Is also know as `transactional model` because it is responsible for managing transactions. It is responsible for ensuring that the system is running smoothly and that all transactions are processed correctly.

`OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)` is a type of operational model that is used to manage transactions in real-time. It is used in systems where transactions need to be processed quickly and efficiently.

Operational models are designed to be fast and efficient. They are optimized for processing transactions quickly and accurately. They are designed to handle a large number of transactions at the same time.

## Analytic models

Analytic models are used to analyze data and generate insights. They are used to answer questions like "What happened?" and "Why did it happen?". Analytic models are used to analyze data and generate insights that can be used to make better decisions.

Also known as `Data Warehouse` because it is responsible for storing and analyzing data. 

It's used in a global view of the system.

## Differences between Operational and Analytic models

- Operational models are responsible for managing transactions, while analytic models are responsible for analyzing data.

- Analytic models are used to make decisions based on data, while operational models are used to keep the system running.

- Operational models produce data, while analytic models analyze data.

- Operational models is used based on `CRUD` operations, while analytic models are used based on `Insert and Select` operations.

- Operational models does not keep historical data, while analytic models keep historical data.

- Operational models is process based system, while analytic models is business based system.

- Operational models wants to keep data integrity, while analytic models wants to keep data consistency.

- Operational system may have a lot of data redundancy, while analytic system has no data redundancy.

- Operational system may have a lot of data, while analytic system has a **big** amount of data.
